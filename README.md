* Project for Chinese Statistical Modeling Competition in 2017
* A data-mining system of methods for binary classification based on imbalanced data â€“ research on bank telemarketing campaign
1. Data Pre-Processing: handling missing values, one-hot encoding, training set, cross-validation set, test set
2. Feature Selection: RFE, Boruta, XGBoost
3. Data Resampling: undersampling (NCL, Tomek Link Removal, K-means clustering), oversampling (Bootstrap, SMOTE)
4. Classifier: KNN, LDA, naive bayes, logistic regression, ID3 decision tree, C50 decision tree, random forest, neural network,
   MLP, SVM, multi-SVM, LightGBM
5. Ensemble Learning: XGBoost-stacking
6. Numeric Evaluation: precision = 0.49, recall = 0.86, F-Score = 0.70
