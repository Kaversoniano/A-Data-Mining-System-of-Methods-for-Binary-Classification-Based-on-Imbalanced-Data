* Project for Chinese Statistical Modeling Competition in 2017
* A data-mining system of methods for binary classification based on imbalanced data â€“ research on bank telemarketing campaign
1. Data Pre-Processing: handling missing values, one-hot encoding, training set, cross-validation set, test set
2. Data Visualization: numeric variable (kernel density estimation, boxplot), categorical variable (histogram, mosaic plot, violin plot)
3. Feature Selection: RFE, Boruta, XGBoost
4. Data Resampling: undersampling (NCL, Tomek Link Removal, K-means clustering), oversampling (Bootstrap, SMOTE)
5. Classifier: KNN, LDA, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, ID3 Decision Tree, C50 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network,
   MLP, SVM, multi-SVM, LightGBM
6. Ensemble Learning: XGBoost-stacking
7. Numeric Evaluation: precision = 0.49, recall = 0.86, F-Score = 0.70
